**Problem Statement:**  *Air Pollution is one of the most serious problems in the world. It refers to the contamination of the atmosphere by harmful chemicals or biological materials.* 

*Two of the worst pollution problems in the world are urban air quality and indoor air pollution &amp; to solve the problem of air pollution, it's necessary to understand the issues and look for ways to counter it.* 

*Air pollution can cause long-term and short-term health effects. It's found that the elderly and young children are more affected by air pollution.* 

*Air pollution causes damage to crops, animals, forests, and bodies of water. It also contributes to the depletion of the ozone layer, which protects the Earth from the sun's UV rays.* 

*Human activities have been highlighted as the major causes of air pollution, especially in the cities.* 

*Air pollution is also caused by natural events: Biological decay and volcanoes release natural sulfur dioxides and nitrogen oxides, affecting air quality in negative ways*

**Approach**

*There are some things you can do to help keep the air cleaner. Generally, it's important to conserve energy because sources of energy like electricity, diesel, gasoline, and wood would contribute to air pollution.*

*We contributed in CLEAN AIR MISSION by building a Swing Application which would help Client to check Air Quality Index (Air-Statistic) and predict the Air Pollution of a city.*

*We tried to rationalize the Air Pollution problem by taking 5 Enterprises & 14 Organizations under our System.*

*Through Inter-Communication between these Organizations and Enterprises we tried to cover every which helps us to reduce Air Pollution.*
